1.	1. int is atomic, because it cannot be broken into other types
	in the syntax. It is first-class, because it supports operations 
	the same as "all other" types.

	2. int* is not atomic, as it is a compound of the type "int" with the
	constructor "*". Whether it is first-class or not, depends on its use.
	If int* is used as an iterator over an array, then it is first-class.
	However if int* is the pointer to the beggining of an array, then to
	correctly use it we cannot simply assign values to it, and need to use
	"free" when ending the use of it. Thus whether int* is first-class
	or not depends on its use.

	3. void is not atomic, as it is not possible to create variables of
	that type, pass it to functions, and even functions that "return void"
	don't actually return anything.

	4. struct with 2 int is not atomic, by definition it is a compound of
	2 smaller atomic types. It is not first class, because it needs
	specific functions and header to be used by other functions.

	5. A string (when made up of a series of chars) is not atomic, as by
	the given definition it is made up of a series of characters, ending
	with '\0'. It is not first-class because a different sset of functions
	is needed to handle string operations than other types such as int.

	6. The types created when defining an enum ARE atomic. Although under
	the surface the types arre represented as numbers (enumerated), on
	the top level an enum is just a new type, that cannot be separated
	into atomic parts. The types in the enum are first-class, because all
	functions in the language done to an int or char can also be done
	with the enumerated types.

	7. A function from int to int is atomic, because as a function itself,
	it cannot be separated into smaller types that are atomic. It is not
	first-class, because it cannot (in C) be assigned a value for example.
